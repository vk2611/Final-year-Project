# Final-year-Project

### In this work, our approach used an ensemble of four classification model instances. The neural network architecture mainly consisted of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers extracted features and transformed input images into hierarchical feature maps. The pooling layers (incorporating max pooling and average pooling) merged semantically similar features into one to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted features. The fully connected layers combined these features and produced an image-level classification. This will enable doctors to start the treatment of the detected disease before it became too serious.
